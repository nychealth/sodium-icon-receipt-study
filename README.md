## Dataset and Code Notes:  
The dataset and SAS program with code were created in SAS Enterprise Guide 7.1. The dataset can be imported into statistical software programs other than SAS (e.g., R, Python, SPSS), but the language in the SAS program is specific to SAS software packages (e.g., SAS Enterprise Guide, SAS 9.4).  
## Abstract:  
In 2016, New York City (NYC) began enforcing a sodium warning regulation at chain restaurants, requiring placement of an icon next to any menu item containing ≥2,300 mg sodium. As shifts in consumer purchases are a potential outcome of menu labeling, we investigated whether high-sodium purchases from NYC chains changed following policy implementation. Using receipts for verification, consumer purchases were assessed at 2 full-service (FSR) and 2 quick-service (QSR) chain restaurants in NYC and Yonkers, NY, which did not implement sodium menu labeling, in 2015 and 2017. Primary outcomes included the proportion of respondents purchasing high-sodium item(s) (containing ≥2,300 mg sodium) and mean sodium content of purchases; changes were assessed by difference-in-difference regression models, adjusted for demographic and location co-variates. At both FSR and QSR, there was not a significant change in the proportion of NYC respondents purchasing 1 or more high-sodium items, relative to Yonkers (FSR difference-in-difference: -4.6%, p=0.364; QSR difference-in-difference: -8.9%, p=0.196). Among NYC FSR respondents, mean sodium content of purchases significantly declined compared to Yonkers (difference-in-difference: -524 mg, p=0.012); no changes in mean sodium were observed among QSR participants (difference-in-difference: 258 mg, p=0.185). Although there was a reduction in mean sodium content of purchases among NYC FSR patrons following sodium warning icon implementation, the mechanism behind the relatively larger NYC decline is unknown.
